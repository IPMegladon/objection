Command: ios keychain dump

Usage: ios keychain dump [--json <filename>] [--smart]

Extracts the keychain items for the current application. This is achieved by iterating
over the keychain type classes available in iOS and populating a search dictionary
with them. This dictionary is then used as a query to SecItemCopyMatching() and the
results parsed.

Flags:
   --json <filename>   Output results as JSON to the specified file, includes a 'dataHex' key
   --smart             Attempt smart decoding of items in the keychain

By default, only a small subset of each entry is displayed. For a more complete dump,
use the --json flag.

Items that will be accessible include everything stored with the entitlement group used
during the patching/signing process.

Examples:
   ios keychain dump
   ios keychain dump --json keychain.json
   ios keychain dump --json keychain.json --smart
